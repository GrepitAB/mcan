pub use fugit;

/// Trait representing CAN peripheral identity
///
/// Types implementing this trait is expected to be used as a marker type that
/// serves the purpose of identifying specific instance of CAN peripheral
/// available on the platform (as there might be more than one). It only conveys
/// *where* the CAN peripheral HW register is located, not necessarily that it
/// can be accessed. The latter is expressed by the [`Dependencies`] trait.
///
/// It is also useful for associating [`Dependencies`] with specific [`CanId`]
/// and setting up additional type constraints preventing application developers
/// from constructing a CAN abstraction with incompatible set of dependencies.
///
/// More details in [`Dependencies`] documentation.
///
/// # Safety
/// `CanId::ADDRESS` points to the start of a valid HW register of a CAN
/// peripheral
///
/// # Examples
/// ```no_run
/// use mcan_core::CanId;
///
/// pub enum Can0 {}
///
/// unsafe impl CanId for Can0 {
///     const ADDRESS: *const () = 0xDEAD0000 as *const _;
/// }
///
/// pub enum Can1 {}
///
/// unsafe impl CanId for Can1 {
///     const ADDRESS: *const () = 0xBEEF0000 as *const _;
/// }
/// ```
pub unsafe trait CanId {
    /// Static address of HW register controlling corresponding CAN peripheral
    const ADDRESS: *const ();
}

/// Trait representing CAN peripheral dependencies
///
/// Structs implementing [`Dependencies`] should
/// - enclose all object representable dependencies of [`CanId`] and release
///   them upon destruction
/// - be constructible only when it is safe and sound to interact with CAN
///   peripheral (respective clocks and pins have been already configured)
/// - be a singleton (only a single instance of [`Dependencies`] for a specific
///   [`CanId`] must exist at the same time)
///
/// in order to prevent aliasing and guarantee that high level abstractions
/// provided by [`mcan`] are sole owners of the peripheral.
///
/// Depending on a target HAL API capabilities this can assured either in
/// compile-time by type constraints or by fallible [`Dependencies`] struct
/// construction.
///
/// # Safety
/// While [`Dependencies`] type instance exists
/// - CAN related clocks must not change
/// - CAN related pins modes must not change
/// - HW register must not be safely accessible by application developer and
///   accessed in other parts of the target HAL
///
/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// // This is just an example implementation, it is up to the `mcan`
/// // integrator how to guarantee the soundness of `mcan` usage
/// // with the target HAL API.
