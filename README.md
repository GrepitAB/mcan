# MCAN

> The M\_CAN is a CAN IP module that can be realized as a standalone
> device, as part of an ASIC or on an FPGA. It performs communication
> according to ISO11898-1:2015. It supports Classical CAN and CAN FD
> (CAN with Flexible Data-rate). Additional transceiver hardware is
> required for connection to the CAN physical layer. The message
> storage is intended to be a single or dual-ported Message RAM
> outside of the module. It is connected to the M\_CAN via the Generic
> Master Interface. Depending on the chosen integration, multiple M\_CAN
> controllers may share the same Message RAM. The Host CPU is connected
> via the 32-bit Generic Interface.[^1]

## Repository content

This repository provides two crates:

### mcan

It contains a platform-agnostic HAL for MCAN, with support for
- classical CAN and CAN FD with bitrate switching
- message transmission using dedicated buffers, FIFO and priority queue
- message reception using dedicated buffers and two FIFOs
- message transmission cancellation
- filter settings

### mcan-core

It contains traits meant to be implemented by target HALs in order
to resolve platform-specific details
